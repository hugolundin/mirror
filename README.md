# Mirror

## Description
`mirror` is a simple tool to continuously mirror a directory into another location.

## Usage
Basic usage of mirror is easy. Just navigate to the folder you want to mirror and run:
```bash
mirror "~/Desktop/mirroring_target"
```
Mirror will continuously copy the base directory into the `mirroring_target`, until you stop it.
